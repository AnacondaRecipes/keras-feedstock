      description: |
        Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library
        written in Python and capable on running on top of either
        TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling
        fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with
        the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
